# Gallery

This is the script I use for my website's image gallery right now.  Rather than using some sort of cms to handle images I just place (any number of) new images in my directory and it'll add them to my gallery page.

## Dependancies

Make sure you've got imagemagick and sed on your machine.

## Customising the image tag

If you want to change the html for each image you add, you'll have to do that manually.  This can be done by editing the sed command in the script.  **Be sure to remember to escape characters since we're using " insead of '**.
